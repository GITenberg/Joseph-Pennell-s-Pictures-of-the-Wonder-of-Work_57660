<h2>
THE WONDER OF WORK INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p>
Work to-day is the greatest thing in the world, and the artist
who best records it will be best remembered. Work has
always been an inspiration to artists, from the time when we were
told to earn our bread by the sweat of our brow, till now, when
most of us are trying to forget the command, and act like "ladies and
gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
Under the Church, work—the building of the Tower of Babel and
the Temple—was the subject of endless imaginings by painters, sculptors
and gravers who never assisted at the functions they illustrated.
Painters, who sat in their studios hundreds of years after the towers
and temples were designed and destroyed, have showed what they
imagined the towers and the temples looked like. This—this sort of
creation or invention—we art students in America called "genius
work" because it was "done out of our heads." In Europe it is
called "scholarly," and is concocted from a classical dictionary; a trip
for a few weeks to Greece or Italy is useful but not necessary, and
adds to the expense; illustrated post cards may be used instead.
</p>

<p>
Now educated people, cultured people, take such painters seriously—and
pay to sit in darkened chambers and brood. These are carefully
but sadly illuminated, and the spectators pursue with diligence, scarce
looking at the exhibits, the remarks of critics who prove conclusively
that these painters show exactly what the world was like, what buildings
were like and how they were built, and how the builders worked
according to the bookman and archæologist, and the critic.
</p>

<p>
Now as to these popular forms of art—the backbone of academics,—I
know, for I am a multi-academician—I have nothing to say. The
results, in a few instances, have been works of art because of excellence
of technique. But the man with the greatest imagination is the man
with the greatest information about his own surroundings, which he
uses so skilfully that we call the result imagination, and this is the way
the greatest art of the world has been created.
</p>

<p>
I am not disputing the power, in their day, nor the charm they
still have—for the very few who understand—of Cimabue, of Giotto,
of the painters of the Campo Santo at Pisa, when they painted the
subjects I have mentioned, nor of Pintoricchio—he put work in the
background of his paintings, as Dürer did in his prints. And there
is a wonderful building of a cathedral by Van Eyck in Antwerp. There
are compositions by Bellini and Carpaccio which show they studied
work. It is strange, so far as I know, that Leonardo ignored work—in
his pictures—he who was such a great workman, yet vowed he
could paint with any one, amongst his other accomplishments. But,
with all these artists, either work was a detail or imaginative; it was
never the dominant motive, never a study of work for work's sake.
There are a few records in sculpture, most notable amongst them
being the Assyrian Reliefs at the British Museum. Curiously, I am
unable to find, though they must exist, any sculptures, reliefs or paintings
of the great architectural work of the Egyptians—or those of the
Greeks either. In the Bayeux tapestries there is the work of the shipbuilder
and porter.
</p>

<p>
The first artist I know of—though I am not an art historian—to
see the pictorial possibility of work, the Wonder of Work for Work's
Sake, was Rembrandt.
</p>

<p>
Rembrandt saw that his father's mill was beautiful, and by his
renderings of the windmills and the dykes of Holland proved them the
great works of his little country, and showed they were pictorial. And
he drew, etched and painted them because he loved their big powerful
forms, their splendid sails, the way they lorded the land and kept out
the sea. They were for him the Wonder of Work, the wondrous
works of his time, the works that were all about him. So strong and
so powerful were these Dutch works that they have lasted till to-day,
and so well were they designed that all windmills and watermills have
kept their form till now. The working parts have possibly been improved,
but the design has not been changed, and Rembrandt's etchings—so
accurately drawn they would serve as working models—prove
it. And yet Rembrandt has made a perfect artistic composition
as well as a true mechanical rendering of these mills and dykes. And
as Whistler said in the "Ten O'clock," the Bible of Art, Rembrandt
regretted not that the Jews of the Ghetto were not Greeks, nor—may
I add?—did he regret the windmills were not temples.
</p>

<p>
Then came Claude and found the Wonder of Work in commercial
harbours, dominated by necessary lighthouses, and in the hustling
cities of Civita Vecchia and Genoa—for it is amid the work, the life
of one's own time, that the Wonder of Work is to be found.
</p>

<p>
Canaletto followed, and saw in the building of Venice the same
inspiration that Tintoret found in her history, Titian in her great men.
And Piranesi discovered the prisons, the Carceri, to be as enthralling
as the ruins of Rome.
</p>

<p>
Turner imitated Claude. Claude saw his subjects about him;
Turner used Claude's motives and tried to rival his predecessor.
Claude painted what he saw in his own time; Turner tried to reconstruct
his unconscious rival's facts out of his head, and failed even in
his rendering of work about him, signally in Steam, Rain, Speed,
where an impossible engine conducts itself in an incredible fashion
in a magnificent landscape. Turner was not here trying to carry on
tradition—the only thing worth doing in art—but to <i><span lang="fr_FR">embêter les
bourgeois</span></i>—and Ruskin!
</p>

<p>
Turner's Carthage would not stand up, if built—Claude's palaces
do. Turner, too, defying Ruskin—Ruskin anathematising workaday
England—was a spectacle. But Turner was sometimes in the right,
with Constable and Crome, and they, and not Ruskin, have triumphed.
Turner had magnificent ideas, wonderful colour sense, grand composition.
But when he came to fact he was often ridiculous or pitiful,
simply because he had not observed work, noted facts—and to paint
work one must study work. And lately I was given a print from a
Book of Beauty by Allom of a coke furnace, while Mr. Joseph Jackson
has discovered a painting of a forge by Bass Otis in the Pennsylvania
Academy of the Fine Arts—surprisingly well done, both are, too.
</p>

<p>
It is far easier to paint a heavenly host or a dream city in one's
studio than to make a decoration out of a group of miners, or to draw
a rolling mill in full blast. Yet one of these subjects can be as noble
as the other, as Whistler proved, when he showed for the first time
how in London "the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky,
and the tall chimneys become campanile, and the warehouses are
palaces in the night, and the whole city hangs in the heavens and
fairyland is before us." That is the Gospel of the Wonder of Work.
</p>

<p>
Though I never studied under Whistler—never was his pupil—he
is and always will be my master—the master of the modern world,
the master who will endure. Because he glorified the things about
him, the things he knew, by "The Science of the Beautiful." What
are the Thames etchings—"Wapping," "The Last of Old Westminster,"
"The Nocturnes"—but records of work? A fact most
critics have never realised. But Whistler was a many-sided—a so
many-sided—genius that his many essays in many fields are only just
becoming known, and this study of work—the most difficult study
in the world, under the most trying conditions—was never abandoned
by him till he said what he wanted, in the ways he wanted, not till he
had made a series of masterpieces which live and will live forever.
</p>

<p>
But there was a man—all the great have gone from us in the last
few years, which accounts for the momentary popularity of the little—there
was a man who gave his later life to the Wonder of Work—Constantin
Meunier.
</p>

<p>
"<i><span lang="fr_FR">Un jour—Meunier approchait déjà de la cinquantaine—Camille
Lemonnier l'emmena dans le Hainaut: il devait y faire quelques
illustrations pour La Belgique. Ce voyage de Meunier à travers le
Borinage lui fut une révélation. Il s'y découvrit lui-même, il y
découvrit son art. Dans ce sombre paysage de fumée et de feu, dans
le halètement formidable des fabriques, parmi les farouches mineurs
et les puddleurs et les verriers, toute une humanité damnée à la peine,
son âme tragique s'emplit de cette pitié et de cette admiration qui
devaient résonner à travers tout son art. Il avait conquis son propre
domaine.</span></i>
</p>

<p>
"<i><span lang="fr_FR">Meunier a conquis à l'art la beauté spéciale de la nouvelle industrie:
la formidable fabrique, pleine de lumière sombre et de tonnerre,
les fêtes flamboyantes des fonderies, la puissance grondante des
machines. Et toujours cette tendance est au monumental.</span></i>
</p>

<p>
"<i><span lang="fr_FR">L'hymne au Travail chante avec plus de force lyrique encore
dans ses bronzes.</span></i>"
</p>

<p>
This was his life work, and the life of his world, the world, as with
Whistler, around him, for "that is best which nearest lieth." Courbet
in work had influenced Legros and Brett and Millet and Segantini,
and I have no doubt Ford Madox Brown, the man too big to be a
pre-Raphaelite, whose biggest picture is work—"Work in London"—the
man who will one day make Manchester a place of pilgrimage
because of his pictures of work and of war in the Town Hall.
</p>

<p>
The Japanese count for a little in work, Hokusai and Hiroshigi.
Repine and De Nittis, L'Hermette, Bastien-Lepage, Tissot, Ridley,
and W. L. Wyllie have shown the Wonder of Work, the last three on
the Thames; and hundreds of imitators of these men have starved
peasants, herded kine, rowed boats, and sat in harvest fields, and
hauled barges, because they thought it the correct thing to do, or else
that they could work the sentimental, pathetic, socialistic game as a
diversion from mummy's darling, baby and the mustard-pot, dear
little doggie, or poor old Dobbin. I do not mean to say there have not
been, there are not, artists who have cared for the work and workers
of the fields for their own sake: there are some; but I wish to speak
only of industrial work. Millet has, I believe, honestly done the life
around his home, the life of the fields, but, though he has endless
imitators, there are scarcely any painters to-day who see through their
own eyes the real life of the fields and farms and the fisherman—they
are blinded by the Frenchman and debauched with sentiment.
</p>

<p>
It was incredible, but at the Panama-Pacific Exposition there was
not one single official "mural" devoted to the glorification of the greatest
work of modern times—the Panama Canal—the reason for the Exposition—in
fact, there was only one in which there was any attempt
at making a decoration out of the things the artist might have known
or seen save Mr. Trumbull's Iron Workers in the Pennsylvania Building—and
a few rather unimportant things in the Dutch and Argentine
Pavilions.
</p>

<p>
Meunier showed without sentiment the workman at work, not
with any idea of preaching about his wrongs, his trials, his struggles,
his misery, but to show the Wonder of Work for its own sake, and the
pictorial possibilities of workmen and workwomen in Belgium.
Meunier showed that the workman was worthy of the artist's chisel,
chalk, needle, and paint. There is no sentiment about Meunier; there
is grandeur, dignity, and power, and from him we have learned that
modern work is wonderful. Meunier was an old man when a few
years ago I first heard of him and saw his work. He had then done
his heroic "Antwerp" and his puddlers and miners in bronze, his
paintings and his chalk drawings, his decorations, his great apse for
the unbuilt basilica—the monument to modern work and workers.
His work is decorative because it is true, and this brings up another
side of the Wonder of Work. In France, Germany, and Italy the
Wonder of Work around us has been made the subject of endless
commissions from the State to artists mostly realistic. But records
of facts, facts of one's own time, in England and America, are scarcely
ever recorded. Go to the Royal Exchange, in London, and you will
find Wat Tyler, Phœnicians, Britons painted blue, and everything in
the history of London that can be made into a painting of the past,
and not a single record of the present. Where is the building of the
Tower Bridge, the Power Houses, the Docks, the Blackwall Tunnel,
the Trams, the Tube, or any of the other works by which this age, this
workaday age, has distinguished itself, all of which are worth painting?
In America we have imaginings of Holy Grails, Pied Pipers, Religious
Liberties, when one fact in "murals" about steel works, skyscrapers,
or the Brooklyn Bridge would be worth the lot in the future,
when these factless fancies are whitewashed out, or made a good
ground to paint on. One man in America, W. B. Van Ingen, has
glorified work by his Panama decorations in the Administration
Building at Balboa. These were not wanted at the Panama Exhibition.
In France men like Henri Martin have painted decoratively,
yet realistically, the harvest of last summer; Besnard and Anquetin
have done wonders; and the biggest French artists have decorated the
Mairies. In Chicago they turn students out to make "murals" in
school houses, a system of artistic debauchery worthy of Chicago's originality.
And Puvis de Chavannes, first of all magnificently showed the
way to combine the old decoration with the new realism. His life work
at Amiens is pure convention, so are his designs in the Boston Library
and in the Sorbonne, but they are the most perfect examples of
decorative, imaginative, conventional work in the modern world.
</p>

<p>
At Rouen and Marseilles he has treated decoratively modern
subjects, or rather he has used modern motives. At Rouen, the city
with its spires and chimneys, its old bridges and new transporters, as
seen from Bon Secours, prove the Wonder of Work; in the foreground
are modern figures, greeting the Spirit of old France. At
Marseilles there are two subjects in which symbolism and realism,
modernity and mediævalism are harmonised—the most difficult problem
to solve; but Puvis has solved it, and proved himself the greatest
if not the only decorator since Pierro della Francesco, the supreme
master of decoration. Raphael, in the Stanzi of the Vatican, was a
decorator of his own time, and so was Pintoricchio in the Library at
Siena, and Mantegna at Padua, for they made decoration out of the
life about them.
</p>

<p>
And John Lavery has made, in Glasgow, a decoration out of
shipbuilding which is worth the whole wall coverings of the Royal
Exchange and the Library of Congress, and the Carnegie Institute
put together. But decoration is a difficult matter, and Lavery has
done much for Glasgow. I regret that John Alexander and E. A.
Abbey, who had far better official opportunities, only proved how
unfit the average painter is to decorate.
</p>

<p>
From the very beginning I have cared for the Wonder of Work;
from the time I built cities of blocks and sailed models of ships of
them across the floor in my father's office, till I went to the Panama
Canal, I have cared for the Wonder of Work. There are others who
care—Brangwyn has cared, and so have Sauter, Muirhead Bone,
Strang and Short. Crane and Anning Bell, Way, Cameron, Bone
and Brangwyn have cared for the building up and the breaking down,
and Brangwyn for life—the life of the workman, possibly because of
his Belgian and seafaring education or his knowledge of Meunier, his
countryman. And Seymour Haden's "Breaking-up the Agamemnon"
is notable. And there are Belgians like Baertsoen, de Bruyeke
and Pierre Paulus; and Frenchmen like Lepere, Gillot and Adler;
and Italians like Pieretto Bianco, and there was the great German
Menzel.
</p>

<p>
But it is to America we must turn, to White's etching of Brooklyn
Bridge, Cooper's skyscrapers, Alden Weir's New York at night,
Bellow's docks, Childe Hassam's high buildings, Thornton Oakley's
coal breakers—to these one must look for the modern rendering of
work. There are others, too, who have seen the opportunity to prig
and steal—but this is evident, just as it is evident that they will give
up painting or drawing work for the next new thing. And there is
another artist who really cares for the Wonder of Work. I do not
know what else Van Ingen has done, but he has made a huge decoration
of Culebra Cut—and Paul Bartlett has put American work on
the pediment of the Capitol. I have tried to do what I could in
New York, Chicago, San Francisco, the coal mines of my native State—Niagara—and
in Europe and at Panama; and whatever their
worth, I can only tell of the Wonder of Work as I see it.
</p>

<p>
New York, as the incoming foreigner, full of prejudice, or doubt,
or hope, and the returning American, crammed with guide-book and
catalogue culture, see it or might see it, rises a vision, a mirage of the
lower bay, the colour by day more shimmering than Venice, by night
more magical than London. In the morning the mountains of buildings
hide themselves, to reveal themselves in the rosy steam clouds
that chase each other across their flanks; when evening fades, they
are mighty cliffs glimmering with glistening lights in the magic and
mystery of the night. As the steamer moves up the bay on the left
the Great Goddess greets you, a composition in colour and form,
with the city beyond, finer than any in any world that ever existed,
finer than Claude ever imagined, or Turner ever dreamed. Why did
not Whistler see it? Piling up higher and higher right before you is
New York; and what does it remind you of? San Gimignano of the
Beautiful Towers away off in Tuscany, only here are not eleven, but
eleven times eleven, not low mean brick piles, but noble palaces
crowned with gold, with green, with rose; and over them the waving,
fluttering plume of steam, the emblem of New York. To the right,
filmy and lace-like by day, are the great bridges; by night a pattern
of stars that Hiroshigi never knew. You land in streets that are
Florence glorified. You emerge in squares more noble than Seville.
Golden statues are about you, triumphal arches make splendid frames
for endless vistas; and it is all new and all untouched, all to be done,
and save for the work of a few of us, and we are Americans, all undone.
The Unbelievable City, the city that has been built since I
grew up, the city beautiful, built by men I know, built for people I
know. The city that inspires me, that I love. And all America is
like this and—all—or nearly all unseen, unknown, untouched.
</p>

<p>
I went to Panama because I believed that, in the making of the
greatest work of modern time, I should find my greatest inspiration.
</p>

<p>
Almost before I left the Canal, artists, architects and decorators
were on their way there. I hope it may interest them half as much
as it interested me. One man has succeeded, I repeat, in doing something
for himself down there—W. B. Van Ingen—and this has been
acknowledged by the government, which has purchased his great
decoration. This is the finest, in fact the only complete decorative
work from him done in the United States—and done because Van
Ingen, the pupil of La Farge—who alone counts—was trained in the
right way and had something to say for himself.
</p>

<p>
We have recently been told that art will disappear in fifty years
(by a person who says he will call his last book—with possible appropriateness—<i>Vale</i>).
But, though he will disappear, and Post Impressionism
will be swallowed up in shopkeeping, and war has engulfed
that, and work is stopped—save for war—and though the
mustard pot has gone with the soulful doggie, and the tearful baby
rival of the Dresden Madonna, the artist who has something to say
in his own way about his own time, and can say it, will live, and his
work will live, with Rembrandt, Velasquez, Franz Hals, Meunier,
and Whistler—artists who painted and drew the work and life about
them, who carried on tradition, and never regretted the past. And
art which shows life and work will never die, for such art is everlasting,
undying, "The Science of the Beautiful."

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUILDING THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS
</h2>

<p>
This etching proves that my love of the Wonder of
Work is no new thing, for it was done in 1881, out of
my studio window in Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, on the
hot morning that Garfield was shot. Even then I knew
what I wanted to do, but I had no idea that—with certain
breaks—all my life would be given to the Wonder of
Work—the work that is all about us, the most wonderful
thing in the world.

II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE NEW HOUSE, PHILADELPHIA
</h2>

<p>
I can remember the bed of mortar in the street, the
hod-carrier toiling up the ladder, the bricklayers above
on the scaffold, and I have drawn such things; but to find
during one's lifetime such a development of building in my
own city is amazing, but it is well worth recording—this
phase of the Wonder of Work.

III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MANUFACTURERS' CLUB AND STOCK
EXCHANGE, PHILADELPHIA
</h2>

<p>
One hot summer evening I was asked to dine at the
University Club, and this drawing is the result. I
had no idea that I would get anything but—as one always
does in Philadelphia—a good dinner. I have forgotten
the good dinner and the doubtless good talk, but I shall
never forget the towering buildings, in the coming night,
grouped round the low houses, and the dark hole from
which the steel skeleton was emerging, soon to become
higher and mightier than the grim masses amid which it
was growing. So I came back the next day and drew it.

IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OIL REFINING, POINT BREEZE
</h2>

<p>
If any one cares to look up a copy of the <i>Century Magazine</i>—or
it was then <i>Scribner's</i>—for about 1880 or
1881, there will be found in it my first published drawing
of the Wonder of Work—and of this same oil refinery at
Point Breeze. Now I am back in Philadelphia, years after,
and I have found the same subject as full of inspiration as
ever. And though the editors of that date were willing to
publish my drawings of such subjects then—now they won't
have them, or use those of my flatterers—I mean imitating
thieves. But there is scarce an art editor left—that profession
scarce exists any longer.

V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OIL WELLS, ALBERTA
</h2>

<p>
I have never yet found a perfectly satisfactory oil
field, as a subject for the Wonder of Work. The wells
are not big enough, they are all alike, and there is no smoke.
I confess I once thought an oil well gushed like a geyser,
hundreds of feet in the air, and, when it was not doing that,
belched forth gorgeous columns and clouds of smoke. I was
told that the first was prevented with difficulty, and that
by dropping a match into the pipe I could easily produce
the second effect—though either might cost me a million;
still, the fact remains, I have yet to find a really fine oil
field—and a really fine effect over it. The refineries, however,
make up for the wells.

VI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEEL AT GARY, INDIANA
</h2>

<p>
If there is anything in carrying on tradition it is here,
for here at these new works, the engineers, the steel
makers, have built mills which are nothing more than Rembrandt's
mills glorified and magnified. And everything in
the Wonder of Work is only carrying on tradition. Every
mill, every dock, every railroad station, every bridge, every
skyscraper is but a development of the work of the Greeks
and Romans. In trying to show this Wonder of Work to-day
I am only trying to do what has been done already
with Greek art and literature. We are not original and
never can be. We may believe we are and prove ourselves
ignorant or cubists, but the cubists are so ignorant—or
think the public are—that they only prig from archaic art.
We can carry on tradition with difficulty; we can easily
turn backward or stand still. Those who have created
the Wonder of Work do not turn back—artists do not—duffers
do.

VII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE JAWS, CHICAGO
</h2>

<p>
Here is the real Chicago. This was the first of these
jaws I ever saw; they are horrible, but fascinating,
and typify the power, frightfulness, and get-there of that
mighty village: picturesque beyond words, terrible beyond
description, fascinating beyond belief. The most amazing
thing in the most amazing mix-up in the world—Chicago.

VIII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STOCK YARDS, CHICAGO
</h2>

<p>
The lines of the pens or corrals, or whatever they are
called, are fascinating to draw—and fascinating it is
to watch the picadors, or cowboys, or whatever you call
them, rounding up the cattle, and all the lines of the design
lead up to the packing-houses which fill the distance. I
have never been in them, don't want to go, and have no interest
in the social, financial, or sanitary condition of them.
I am always being criticised for lacking interest in such
matters, but my critics do not realize I am simply an artist
searching for the Wonder of Work—not for morals—political
economy—stories of sweating—the crime of ugliness.
I am trying to record the Wonder of Work as I see
it, that is all.

IX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNDER THE BRIDGES, CHICAGO

<p>
Bridges should be seen sometimes from below—from
nowhere else are they so impressive. The New York
bridges become a thousand times more impressive, the
Forth Bridge stretches on forever, the Viaduct de Garibault
grows more and more graceful, the bridges at Chicago
grimmer. This is the grimmest I have found.

Always when I have been going or coming east or west
on the Pennsylvania and reached Johnstown I have
meant to stop, for from the train it seemed so fine. Now
I have stopped and know it is far finer than I imagined, and
that there are endless subjects up and down the river banks,

XI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PITTSBURGH, NO. 3

<p>
Way down below the level road on which I stood, way
on the opposite side of the river, Pittsburgh lies a
dark, low mass, hemmed in by its rivers, lorded by its hills;
in the hollow the smoke hangs so dense often I could not see
the city at all, but once in a while a breeze falls on the town,
and the great white skyscrapers come forth from the
thick, black cloud, and the effect is glorious—the glorification
of Work, for Pittsburgh is the work-city of the world.

XII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDGAR THOMSON STEEL WORKS
</h2>

<p>
I found these works and this view of them on a trolley
ride out of Pittsburgh. They group themselves under
their canopy of smoke as finely as any in the world, and
every works in the Wonder of Work has character—just
as a tree has—but how much more impressive is a row of
blast furnaces, oil wells, and coal breakers, than trees! Yet
these are the subjects of our age—naturally, scarcely any
one ever looks at them, especially artists—though I hear
the "young artists" of America have with money prizes
been encouraged to take up "Labor" as a change from
painting "murals"—but you can't help people to be artists
or to see things, they must do it for themselves. The only
artists who see things in the world are engineers and a few
architects, for the mill has taken the place of the cathedral—and
the great craftsmen who once worked for Popes
now work for captains of industry—for art follows money.

XIII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ON THE WAY TO BESSEMER
</h2>

<p>
A few years ago it would have been impossible to have
done, or even found, the subjects in this book, for one
would have had an impossible tramp, or a trip in a hack,
and the nuisance and expense of it all, while the roads rarely
went near the mills or works. Now the trolley whisks you
about, and frequently deserts the roads to get to the mills
and pick up its passengers, the workmen. The trolley is
by far the best guide to the Wonder of Work in the world.
I had no idea what was at Bessemer—or rather on the way
to it. I had been in the works, but as the car mounted the
hill I saw the subject behind me, and at the next stop
jumped off and drew it, and it is in this way my work has
been done. It's all adventure—the adventure of hunting
for the Wonder of Work, and the love of the hunt has
carried me all over Europe and America.

In the works at Homestead what interested me was the
way the mills lie under the hills on the curving river, the
way that winds up to them, the way the graceful iron
bridges span it, and the deep-sighing steamboats push the
barges up and down; the way the clouds mingle with the
smoke—the composition that is there.

XV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COAL BREAKERS, SHENANDOAH
</h2>

<p>
One afternoon, hunting for subjects, I took the trolley
from Mahanoy City in the sunset to Shenandoah, and
as we breasted a hill this is what I saw: the long lines of
crosses are trolley poles—the huge castle a coal breaker,
the great town American, but the people, the miners who
go to the churches which crown it, speak languages and
worship creeds I do not know or understand. There, and
not in Philadelphia, are the new Americans—but most
Americans do not know it—for their ways are not Philadelphia
ways, and their thoughts not those of Spruce
Street. And there is not a man among them who speaks
English hardly—and they are too ignorant to know that
England is their "Mother Land." But there is even more
ignorance in Spruce Street.

XVI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WORK CASTLES, WILKES-BARRE
</h2>

<p>
From the end of the new bridge which has replaced
the wonderful old wooden ones that got one somehow
across the Susquehanna and other American rivers, wandering
just at sunset up the beautiful bank of the beautiful
river, I found this splendid subject. All, many would say,
that was wanted were some knights bringing home fair
ladies; all, others would say, was the poor workman, trudging,
filled with Millet sentiment, whiskey, or his wrongs, to
the filthy hole he is allowed to live in and call his—for the
time—home; for these mining towns, the fault of their inhabitants,
are pigsties—pigsties that no government in
any country in the world but this would permit. It is only
in America that immigrants live like hogs—as they like—no
government in Europe would permit it. I have seen
both hemispheres and know most social reformers have not—and
would not know if they had. We are trying to clean
up the world before we can clean our back yards. But I
only looked at the coal breaker as making, perfecting,
carrying out a composition in a glorious landscape, and
for that reason I sat down and drew it.

XVII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUILDING A POWER-HOUSE, NIAGARA
</h2>

<p>
The purists and the theorists have made a great fuss
about the destruction of the Falls and the vandals who
have done it. Now the Falls, I believe, have not been lowered
an inch, and as for the power-houses, they are most of
them Greek temples, and placed just where the Greeks
would have placed them. For once the Greek temple is
right in America, and therefore the American purist and
theorist doesn't like it—he would not have liked Greek
temples had he been Greek. I did not draw the temples,
but the temples being built, which was interesting. Below
the bridge on the American side are older works, wondrous
works, high on the cliffs, great overflows of water gushing
from the rock. If they were in Tivoli the purists would sit
down between two trains and snapshot the "cute" Villa
d'Else and the "hansome" Villa of Hadrian, or revile the
spaghetti, while a courier quoted Baedeker at them. At
Niagara they take off their clothes, put their feet on the
piazza rail of the Canadian hotel, sigh over the power-houses,
delight in ginger-ale, and forget the Falls, in the
pages of a Saturday Home Magazine. This lithograph is
a proof that engineers design to-day for companies, not
churches.

XX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUTTE, MONTANA, ON ITS MOUNTAIN TOP
</h2>

<p>
Butte is the most pictorial place in America—therefore
no one stops at it—and most people pass it in the
night, or do not take the trouble to look out of the car
windows as they go by. But there it is. On the mountain
side spring up the huge shafts. The top is crowned not
with trees but with chimneys. Low black villages of
miners' houses straggle toward the foot of the mountain.
The barren plain is covered with gray, slimy masses of
refuse which crawl down to it—glaciers of work—from
the hills. The plain is seared and scored and cracked with
tiny canyons, all their lines leading to the mountain. If
you have the luck to reach the town early in the morning
you will find it half revealed, half concealed in smoke and
mist and steam, through which the strange shafts struggle
up to the light, while all round the horizon the snow peaks
silently shimmer above the noisy, hidden town. If you have
the still better fortune to reach it late in the evening you
will see an Alpine glow that the Alps have never seen. In
the middle of the day the mountains disappear and there is
nothing but glare and glitter, union men and loafers about.

I have seen many volcanoes, a few in eruption—that
was terrible—but this great smelter at Anaconda always,
while I was there, pouring from its great stack high
on the mountain its endless cloud pall of heavy, drifting,
falling smoke, was more wonderful—for this volcano is
man's work and one of the Wonders of Work. Dead and
gray and bare are the nearby hills, glorious the snow-covered
peaks far off, but incredible is this endless rolling,
changing pillar of cloud, always there, yet always different—and
that country covered with great lakes, waterless,
glittering, great lava beds of refuse stretching away in
every direction down the mountain sides into the valleys,
swallowing up every vestige of life, yet beautiful with the
beauty of death—a death, a plague which day by day
spreads farther and farther over the land—silently overwhelming,
all-devouring—a silent place of smoke and fire.

<p>
The lines of the winding waterways, each leading to a
furnace, a mill, an elevator, are simply beautiful and
the color absolutely lovely. This is the modern landscape—a
landscape that Claude would have loved. All his composition
is in it—only the mills have replaced the palaces,
the trestle the aqueduct; instead of the stone pine, there
stands the water tower; instead of the cypress, the automatic
signal; instead of the Cross, the trolley pole. Soon,
however, all this will go—the mystery of the smoke will
vanish in the clearness of electricity, and the mystery of the
trestle in the plainness of the concrete bridge. But it is
here now, and the thing is to delight in it. Artists don't
see it—and the railroad men who have made it don't know
any more than the Greeks what a marvellous thing they
have made.

If one wants an idea of what the Culebra Cut looked like,
when the Panama Canal was being dug through the
mountains, it is only necessary to go to the ore mines near
Duluth. There are the same great terraces, the same
steam shovels, digging and loading the dirt, the same engines
and trains, and in some of the pits the forms are
even fine—amphitheatres,—only the seats and steps are
gigantic. But when the shadows begin to creep up from
below, the place becomes a theatre for the gods, a theatre
where there are no spectators, and the actors are the steam
shovels with their white plumes and the engines with their
black clouds. But they are finer far than any poor mummer's
makeshifts. And every now and then comes a burst
of applause as a blast is fired more thrilling than ever heard
in a play theatre. This is the theatre of the Wonder of
Work.

The mills of Minneapolis are as impressive as the

where they group themselves into the same compositions,
with the bridges below them, that I found years ago at
Albi—only the color is different: the rosy red of the
French brick is changed to dull concrete gray. The tree
masses below are the same, and the old stone railroad bridge
over the Mississippi is just as drawable as that over the
Tarn. The beauty of the flour mills is the beauty of use—they
carry out William Morris's theory that "everything
useful should be beautiful"—but I don't know what he
would have said to them. There are other subjects which
recall Tivoli, where the streams gush out from the bluffs or
tumble and rush and roar from dark caverns between the
huge modern masses of masonry as finely as they do in far-away
Italy. Those were the shrines of the gods—these
are the temples of work, the temples of our time.

There are hundreds of these inclines—ascenseurs,

among the numbers at Cincinnati—none in which the pitch
is steeper, the stop so sudden—none where the streets lead
direct to the heart of the city; no city so dominated, concentrated,
at its heart, by its lone white skyscraper, as Cincinnati.
That is why I drew it; and, as I drew, the boy who
opened and shut the gates came and told me he wanted to
be a poet, that he was a poet, and that Poe was the greatest
American author, which most great Americans do not
know, and that he loved Shelley, and so I recommended
Whitman to him, of whom he had not heard, and advised
him to attend to his gates and his poetry and then he might
do something. And he asked me if I had done anything
myself. If I had made good! Well, have I?

The changes in the methods of work between Canaletto's

he drew the building being restored, it was hidden in scaffolding;
when it was rebuilt, as I saw it, a few years ago,
everything was done from the inside, till the top was
reached, men and materials being carried up on elevators.
It is said one of our ingenious American Captains of Labor
offered to rebuild it free if the Venetians would let him put
two elevators in, and have the profits of them for twenty-five
years, after which he would hand it to the city and retire
on the results. The Syndic declined, but put in the
elevators.

I have never seen anything so impressive as the quarries

snow, as many think, but marble—high on the tops of the
mountains, quarried for centuries by regiments of men
who toil on foot, in trains or are swung up in baskets to
the summit. Then down the roughest track, only smoothed
by the blocks, the marble is dragged by teams of oxen,
driven by men sitting backward, to the railroad or the harbor.
The contrast between the dazzling blocks, the blue
sky and black trees, and untouched mountain side is intense.

battered to ruin, but I do know that nowhere in the world

If either you have the brains, or it is clear enough, you
can see this great stack dominating the whole landscape

it and regretted, on an editorial page, that no artist ever
looked at such subjects; but when I not only wrote him
that I had etched it already and sent him a proof to prove
it, he never acknowledged my letter, but he kept the proof.
I may say that in 1883 I made a series of illustrations of
work subjects in Sheffield which were printed in <i>Harper's
Magazine</i>. Two things always impressed me in that town—the
boiling water in the rivers and the abominable habits
of the natives in the streets, who from across the rivers
and behind walls and other safe places "'eave arf a brick"

huge beast, which grows and grows, towering over the
chimneys, the furnaces looming up through the smoke,
always growing and growing, fed by the travellers which
carry to it an endless chain of creaking buckets high in
air, sometimes for a kilometre, over ploughed fields and
slow-moving rivers, to these work mountains.

XLII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE IRON GATE, CHARLEROI, BELGIUM
</h2>

<p>
High in the air the iron gate hangs—the entrance to
the great works. When there is a strike it comes
down, and not only is it topped with sharp spikes, but, I
was told, it could be charged with electricity and is pierced
with holes through which to shoot. On either side are
guard-houses on the wall, fitted with guns—all these preparations
made for strikers, for industrial war. Now
that real war has come, I wonder what part the iron gate
plays.

XLIII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRANES, DUISBURG, GERMANY
</h2>

<p>
I know nothing of the lifting power or any other
accomplishments of these cranes, but I do know
that nowhere in the world are there such huge, such
picturesque cranes as those of Germany, and in Germany
the finest are in and around Duisburg and Hamburg. They
may not carry any more than, or as much as, American
machines, but they are far bigger and more drawable, and
those on the high banks of the Rhine superbly placed, each
full of character, each worth drawing.

The Rhine is wonderful from the sea to the source—but
fine as one finds the old castles and the combinations
of old castles and new mills, the new mills, new Rhine
castles, have made a new river, and they are the most interesting
things on it.

XLV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUILDING THE RAILROAD STATION
LEIPZIG, GERMANY
</h2>

<p>
It is difficult to tell whether an American railroad station
is a Greek temple, a Christian Science church, a free
library, a bank, a museum, or a millionaire's residence or
his tomb. A German railroad station looks like a railroad
station and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
I believe this station is larger—it is certainly far better
designed than anything in America—but the building
of it, with the great, half-finished arches looming up, was a
splendid motive. I was in Leipzig in April, 1914, drew
this; I returned in June and the subject was gone; all that
remained was the Graphic Art and Book Exhibition, the
finest ever held anywhere. And that was ruined by the fools
who brought on the fool war.

Drawn after war was declared with Russia, 1914.
</p>

<p>
It is a fashion of the art critic to praise Japanese arrangement
and construction. No Japanese ever designed
so pictorial and so powerful a bridge as this, yet, on
the whole, it looks like a Japanese bridge and has the feeling
of one, but it is doubtful if the engineer who designed it ever
saw Hiroshigi's prints.

I believe the <i>Bismarck</i> is the biggest ship—or the biggest

fine as anything in the Wonder of Work.

Never anywhere, even in orderly Germany, have I seen
such an orderly place as this steel works, and yet it
was picturesque. Every chimney, retort, and furnace
seemed to be cleaned daily. There was in the late afternoon
light a beautiful blue sheen on the furnaces, the brick of the
chimneys was delicate red which harmonized with the gold
and rose fumes from the blasts, amid all the white smoke
was pierced with purple and blue, and in front was the
greenest grass plot I have ever seen, kept, like all the works,
in perfect order, and around the outer border engines were
dragging the most lurid melted white-hot refuse—roaring
fire.

The pattern of the steel work of this shipbuilding yard

<p>
I shall not tell the story how I made this print—many
others in the book have stories, too—but I will
say that Essen is pictorially among the least interesting of
the great work cities of the world, because, first, much of
it is new, up-to-date and therefore uninteresting artistically,
and, second, because it stands in a plain, surrounded
by high walls, and I never have been able to find a point
where I could see anything. Still, there are great subjects
in the shops, and this is one of them.

I always love these power-houses with their huge
chimneys, but it is rare indeed that they compose so well
as this. But many other industrial palaces in Berlin are
fine: the General Electric Company's works, its dynamo
building shops, and the city gasometers which have been
made into modern work castles of the most enormous
bulk; and the much-written-about flower-covered buildings
of the work people. All these make up the Wonder of
Work in Berlin.

As the Continental express from the Hook of Holland
reached Schiedaam the traveller who was not fast

crowns war—each bastion bears a windmill, while from the
city within the walls endlessly rise and silently drift away
masses of white smoke clouds, showing for one moment,
hiding the next, the spires, towers, and domes of the city.
I do not know what makes the smoke clouds—whether
Schnaaps or not—but there they always are—and are
always to be seen from the station platform from which I
made the drawing.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
